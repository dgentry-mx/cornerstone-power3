Sass Quick Setup
=====================

Follow the steps below to install and spin up a basic Sass watch command:

## Dependencies

1. [Node & NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
2. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)


## Getting Started

1. After installing Sass, create a .scss file in the root of the project (ie: styles.scss).
2. Run the Sass watch command ```sass --watch styles.scss styles.css``` (documentation [here](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#topic-1)).
3. Thats it! after running that command, Sass will create your output file called "styles.css" which is already linked to the index.html.

Quick Local Server
=====================
1. Use VSCode for development
2. Install the Live Server extension from VSCode marketplace https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
3. Open your index.html or any html document and click the 'Go Live' button in the lower right hand corner of VSCode
